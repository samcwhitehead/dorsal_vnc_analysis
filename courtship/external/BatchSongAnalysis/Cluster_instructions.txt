1 - ssh to your home directory

2 - Add matlab to your path

Add this line to your ~/.bashrc: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/matlab-2010a/bin
Do this as follows

>vim ~/.bashrc

press i (for insert), paste line above at end of file

press esc, then :wq

>source ~/.bashrc

3 - login to node and request one matlab license

>qlogin -l matlab=1

This will move you to a node, then type

$ matlab

This starts matlab

Now, navigate to the folder containing the code

>> cd('/groups/stern/sternlab/behavior/Batch_FlySongAnalysis')

Now you can run batch analysis and batch plotting, as follows

>> BatchFlySongAnalysis('../Elizabeth/POC_song_recording/20121219150847_out/',{'strain1' 'wild_type'},{[1 10] [11 18]},{'wild_type' 'other_wild_type'})

This produces time-stamped '_Results_' files
then plot the results

>> PlotAnalysis('../Elizabeth/POC_song_recording/20121219105502_Results_20130102190147/',{'one' 'two' 'three'},['folder3' 'folder1'},{'Ore-R' 'Canton-S'})

This generates two plots for each genotype, one with and one without outliers, which are placed in the 'Results' folder

There are some easy tricks to auto fill in some of the long path names, which I can show you.
 
When you are done type

>> exit
$ exit

This frees up the node you were using and the Matlab license, which is more important. Make sure you always free up the Matlab license when you are done.
