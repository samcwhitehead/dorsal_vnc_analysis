# Dorsal VNC driver line analysis 

MATLAB code used for data analysis and figure generation in (Ehrhardt *et al.*, 2023). The repository is divided into three subsections:
  1. **anatomy**: code pertaining to the analysis of segmented interneurons (INs), ventral unpaired median neurons (VUMs), and motor neurons (MNs) segmented from confocal images of the transgenic *Drosophila* lines introduced in the manuscript. 
  2. **courtship**: code pertaining to the courtship experiments presented in the manuscript, in which wing motor neurons were chronically silenced in male flies and their courtship song production was compared to genetic controls. 
  3. **flight**: code pertaining to the tethered flight experiments presented in the manuscript, in which motor neurons were optogenetically activated during flight and resultant wing kinematic changes were monitored. 

Individual README files can be found within each of these subdirectories.
